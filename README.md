<h1><b> Devops-Books </b></h1>
<h3>The above "Devops.md" contain a Link which will forward you to the Drive folder with lots of Tech related resources and Devops guides. Because,
the folder is extremely large that even Git LFS can't upload (something around 7.00 GB) so i have uploaded it on my Drive and provided a link in it 
Hope it Helps !!!
